# Your Dictionary

#### A User-Created Dictionary with Definitions, January 15th, 2016

#### By Midori Bowen

## Description

This is a Java app that allows a user to create their own dictionary. On the home page, the user is prompted to Add a New Word. Following the next prompt, "Add a New Word", the user can add a word to their dictionary. The word is then saved and the user can then view their dictionary with the button "View Your Dictionary". If they click on that entry, the user can then add a definition by clicking the button "Add a New Definition". On the next page, the user can enter the definition for their word. After submitting this definition, the user will return to the word page. From here they can create more words by first clicking on the "View All Definitions" button.

An additional function that is pending will list all of the definitions with links to their corresponding word. This function will create the ability for the user to test their knowledge of their dictionary.
